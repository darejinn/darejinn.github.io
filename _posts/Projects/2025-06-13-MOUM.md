# 💊 Multi-Omics-Based Drug Sensitivity Estimation

## 📌 Overview
Accurately predicting how a cancer cell line responds to a drug (IC-50) remains an open challenge: the outcome depends not only on the drug’s chemistry but also on the cell’s intricate molecular profile.  
We present an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that **fuses three omics layers (GEP, MUT, CNV)** with advanced **drug-embedding models (ChemBERTa & graph-based GNN)** and a **bi-directional cross-attention mechanism**. Our approach improves upon the 2025 paper [*“Anticancer drug response prediction integrating multi-omics pathway-based difference features and multiple deep-learning techniques.”*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012905)

## 🌱 Why we built this

| Baseline limitation | Our upgrade |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Drug representation lacks structural cues** (only SMILES RNN) | **Two interchangeable drug encoders**<br>• *ChemBERTa* — language-style SMILES embedding<br>• *BGD* — graph transformer on molecular graphs |
| **Shallow “context attention”** can’t model complex drug-omics interplay | **Deep, bi-directional cross-attention** (drug ↔ each omics) giving **6 interaction maps** |

## 🔬 Data

| Source | Entities | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| **CCLE** | 688 cell lines | GEP (log₂ TPM + 1), MUT (0/1/2), CNV (log₂ discrete) |
| **GDSC2** | 233 drugs | Matched IC-50 ground-truth |
| **MSigDB – 619 KEGG pathways** | – | Used to derive pathway-difference statistics (Mann-Whitney U / χ²-G) |

---

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Omics pathway features**  
   For every cell line × pathway, compute statistical separation between “in-pathway” and “out-pathway” genes → 3 feature matrices of size 1 × 619 (GEP, MUT, CNV).

2. **Drug embeddings**  
   *Choose one encoder at training time*  

   | Encoder | Key idea | Output shape |
   | ------- | -------- | ------------ |
   | **ChemBERTa** | Tokenise SMILES, pad to 256, take final hidden CLS | 1 × 384 |
   | **BGD** | Graph transformer over atoms/bonds + DeepChem node feats | 1 × 256 |

3. **Cross-attention block**  
   • Drug (Q) ↔ Omics (K,V) for each omics type, **two directions** (drug→omics, omics→drug) → 6 attention layers in total.  
   • Concatenate pooled outputs → stacked MLP → IC-50 regression.
